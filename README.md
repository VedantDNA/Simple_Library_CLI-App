### ðŸ“š Simple Java Library System (OOP + Dependency Injection)

A beginner-friendly **Java console application** that simulates a basic library system.
Built using clean **object-oriented principles**, including:

* **Composition** (Library service has a book storage system)
* **Constructor-based Dependency Injection**
* **Fixed-size array** for internal data storage (no collections used)

---

### Key Features

* Add new books to the library
* Display all available books
* Uses arrays to simulate in-memory storage (no database, no collections)
* Clean separation of concerns (Models, Storage, Service, Main)

---

### Concepts Practiced

* Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
* Constructor-based Dependency Injection
* Composition and Single Responsibility Principle
* Console-based user interaction with `Scanner`

---

### Tech Stack

* Language: Java 17+
